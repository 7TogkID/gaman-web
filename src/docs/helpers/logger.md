# Logger Utility

The `Logger` utility offers an easy-to-use interface for logging messages at different levels of severity.

## Importing Logger

To use the `Logger` utility, import it from the `gaman` package:

```ts
import { Logger } from "gaman";
```

## Available Methods

### `Logger.info(message: string)`

Logs informational messages that provide general feedback or updates.

```ts
Logger.info("Server has started successfully.");
```

### `Logger.log(message: string)`

Logs standard messages, typically for routine operations.

```ts
Logger.log("User connected to the service.");
```

### `Logger.debug(message: string)`

Logs debug messages intended for development or troubleshooting purposes.

```ts
Logger.debug("Debugging connection parameters: { host: 'localhost', port: 3431 }");
```

### `Logger.warn(message: string)`

Logs warning messages to signal potential problems or caution.

```ts
Logger.warn("Disk usage is nearing capacity.");
```

### `Logger.error(message: string)`

Logs error messages, useful for reporting issues or exceptions.

```ts
Logger.error("Failed to connect to the database.");
```

## Example Usage

### Basic Logging

Hereâ€™s an example of using the `Logger` utility to track server operations:

```ts
import { Logger } from "gaman";

Logger.info("Server is starting...");
Logger.log("Listening on port 3431.");

try {
  // Simulating a successful operation
  Logger.debug("Attempting to connect to the database...");
  // Simulated operation succeeded
  Logger.info("Connected to the database successfully.");
} catch (error) {
  Logger.error("Database connection failed: " + error.message);
}
```

### Best Practices

* Use `Logger.info` for high-level updates and progress.
* Use `Logger.log` for normal operations and tracking.
* Use `Logger.debug` during development to trace issues or inspect application behavior.
* Use `Logger.warn` for important warnings or risks that aren't critical errors.
* Use `Logger.error` for critical failures or exceptions.
